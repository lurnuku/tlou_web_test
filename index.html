	<h1>Just a girl, not a threath</h1>
	<p>If I ever were to lose you</p>
	<p>I'd surely lose myself</p>
	<p>Everything I have found here</p>
	<p>I've not found by myself</p>
	<p>Try and sometimes you'll succeed</p>
	<p>To make this man of me</p>
	<p>All of my stolen missing parts</p>
	<p>I've no need for anymore</p>
	<p>I believe</p>
	<p>And I believe 'cause I can see</p>
	<p>Our future days</p>
	<p>Days of you and me</p>
